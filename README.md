# Calculator-in-Java
"Calculator in Java" is a program that performs arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, 
and division and also sum, variance and standard deviation of an array

This program has three files Calculator.java , CalculatorMain.java and CalculatorUserInput.java 

in which 

- Calculator.java has all method which will be performing options like addition, substraction, division , etc.
[ Methods in this file are add() to add two numbers, subtract() to subtract two numbers, divide() to divide two numbers, multiplication()  to multiply two numbers, exponential() to return exponent of both unmbers, sum() returns sum of the array , variance() returns variance of the array and standarddev() returns standard deviation of the array ] 

- CalculatorUserInput.java has two methods:
    - out of which the insertNumbers() is used to input two numbers and add in array for basic arithmetic operations
    - and the insertArray() is used to input numbers from user and add to array so we can apply operations like sum, variance and standard deviation on it.

And finally CalculatorMain.java has switch case so it gets input from user which operation is to be carried out and that method and operation is called out which finally returns the output.
